# eoViz Marketing Website

Marketing site for eoViz - a modular geospatial storytelling platform for research organizations. This is a prototype to test messaging and positioning before building out the full product suite.

## Background

eoViz helps research organizations turn complex geospatial data into:
- **eoStories**: Compelling narratives that stakeholders understand
- **eoTools**: Custom visualization tools for unique datasets  
- **eoCatalogs**: Organized data platforms for discoverability

**Target audience**: Research organizations with their own geospatial data who need better ways to communicate findings to stakeholders, funders, and decision-makers.

**Key differentiator**: Self-hosted/open source (your data stays yours) vs. proprietary platforms.
